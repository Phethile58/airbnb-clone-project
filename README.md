# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
The **AirBnB Clone Project** is a simplified version of the AirBnB web application.  
The goal is to understand how full-stack applications work by building key features step by step.

## Project Goals
- Build a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.  
- Create a front-end that interacts with the back-end.  
- Develop a RESTful API to connect with the front-end.  
- Store and manage data using databases.  
- Practice collaboration and version control with GitHub.  

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Back-end & CLI)  
- **Flask / FastAPI** (Web framework)  
- **MySQL / SQLite** (Database)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Front-end)  
- **Git & GitHub** (Version control & collaboration)

## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project uses a combination of technologies to handle different aspects of development, from the backend to the frontend and database. Below is an overview of the stack and its purpose:

### 1. **Python**
- A high-level programming language used for backend logic and command-line tools.  
- Provides flexibility and strong libraries for building APIs and handling data.  

### 2. **Django**
- A Python-based web framework.  
- Used to build robust RESTful APIs, manage authentication, and handle backend logic efficiently.  

### 3. **PostgreSQL**
- A powerful open-source relational database.  
- Stores application data such as users, bookings, listings, and reviews.  
- Provides scalability, reliability, and strong query performance.  

### 4. **GraphQL**
- A query language for APIs.  
- Allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, reducing over-fetching.  
- Improves communication between frontend and backend.  

### 5. **JavaScript**
- A dynamic scripting language for client-side interactivity.  
- Powers dynamic elements of the user interface.  

### 6. **HTML & CSS**
